# AG-Net
This is an implementation of AG-Net as described in the paper "Attend and Guide (AG-Net): A Keypoints-driven Attention-based Deep Network for Image Recognition" by  Asish Bera, Zachary Wharton, Yonghuai Liu, Nik Bessis, and Ardhendu Behera. We include the weights for the model which achieves 98.3% accuracy on the test data.
