# AG-Net
This is an implementation of AG-Net as described in the paper "Attend and Guide (AG-Net): A Keypoints-driven Attention-based Deep Network for Image Recognition" by  Asish Bera, Zachary Wharton, Yonghuai Liu, Nik Bessis, and Ardhendu Behera. We include the weights for the model which achieves 98.3% accuracy on the test data. 

We include the iPython Notebook where we derived the model to "show our work", but we also include a python file which directly contains just the necessary code.

Note we coded all of this on our own with the exception of the "Intra Self-Attention" module which we obtained from "https://github.com/heykeetae/Self-Attention-GAN/blob/master/sagan_models.py" (in that context, it's just Self-Attention). 

The weights are available at https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/apo6zpjottsy6w5md2sgg/AG_net_weights2.pth?rlkey=3566v62s2s4cw0pnfmrax6l92&st=sjtemxl0&dl=0
