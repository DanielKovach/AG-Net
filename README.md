# AG-Net
This is an implementation of AG-Net as described in the paper "Attend and Guide (AG-Net): A Keypoints-driven Attention-based Deep Network for Image Recognition" by  Asish Bera, Zachary Wharton, Yonghuai Liu, Nik Bessis, and Ardhendu Behera. We include the weights for the model which achieves 98.3% accuracy on the test data. Note we coded all of this on our own with the exception of the "Intra Self-Attention" module which we obtained from "https://github.com/heykeetae/Self-Attention-GAN/blob/master/sagan_models.py" (in that context, it's just Self-Attention).
